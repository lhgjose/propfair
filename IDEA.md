I want to create a platform that aggregates real estates in Colombia across different websites such as Finca Raiz, Metrocuadrado and Cien Cuadras. The main goal right now is that users can look for houses and apartments in rent, and more importantly, get a data based info as whether the real estate is valued fairly using advanced and cutting-edge ML, DP, AI models. Also, this is a personal project that I want to publish in Github for job hunting. The UI should also be user-friendly and beautiful, and it should include interactive maps so the user can select an area of interest an get the relevant results.
